  <h5>Project Zomboid</h5> 
  
  <p>
  Project zomboid is an open world zombie survival game where you survive as a survivor of the “Knox event” in 1993 at the state of Kentucky. The game is based on a real Kentucky map, the town west point and Louiville is also based on real life example, even though the dev team isn’t in Kentucky. It seems like they chose Kentucky simply because most of the zombie movies are based on USA Kentucky or somewhere like that. This is a realistic, which means it’s hard and some real-life tricks can also be used in game, for example, you can’t drink a bottle of whiskey then chuck a whole plate of pain killer or antibiotic. Your character has a very specific skill menu, were incudes most of the skills that are related to survival.
