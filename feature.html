            <h3>Conditions</h3>
            <p>Just like every other zombie game, you need food, and water but at the same time, you have three more conditions; temperature, board, and sadness. </p>

            <p>Temperature: temperature is a realistic condition in the game. Your temperature drops when in a cold environment or you just wash yourself, rises when in summer or gets a fever.</p>

            <p>Board: Your character gets bored when they don’t have anything to do or don’t see zombies for too long. If it gets too serious, your character gets upset and sad. You can stop being bored by reading books or watching TV.</p>  

            <p>Sadness: As your character gets too board, he will feel sad which makes you take stuff very slowly. Can be cured by eating anti-depressant. </p>
